<h2>About FSMK School portal</h2>
<p>
Mostly fsmk used to get requests from different colleges for conducting faculty development workshop and other day long
workshops. The current practise is all through mail exchange and talking to the resources to check the availability. This is
quite effortfull job. With this portal in place we have all requests managed centrally depending on availbility of speakers and
other factors. Apart from this innumerable no of small sessions are happening across fsmk glugs probably on weekly basis
part of glug meet. More over FSMK School happens every sunday at fsmk office.This is nowhere reported though the entire
management is done in glug level.
