<p>It is quite cumborsome effor for conducting the session on regular basis as finding speakers itself require great effort so that
to avoid repetivie session avoided. The thought for FSMK School begins here. Since summer camp focus mainly on web
technologies we though why we can not have live project to manage FSMK School program and other ad hoc requests from
different colleges and organizations.
